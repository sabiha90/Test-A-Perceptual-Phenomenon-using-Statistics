# Test-A-Perceptual-Phenomenon-using-Statistics

In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task and performed the following:

* Identified components of an experiment
* Used descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
* Set up a hypothesis test, made inferences from a sample, and drew conclusions based on the results
